    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>High in protein, easy to make, and fucking delicious, a good fried egg is hard to beat. Whether you're making breakfast in your underwear or fixing ramen for friends, knowing how to fry an egg is a vital skill any self-respecting person should have. Except vegans.x</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Frying Pan</li>
        <li>Oil or Bacon Grease</li>
        <li>Rubber Spatula</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 2 tablespoons of oil in frying pan over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Crack your egg into the pan. Don't break the yoke, you fool.</li>
        <li>Use the rubber spatula to gently score lines in the white of the egg. (This helps with even cooking.)</li>
        <li>Let the egg cook until the egg whites have become mostly solid.</li>
        <li>Using your spatula, gently release the egg from the pan.</li>
        <li>Take the frying pan handle and make a movement like an ocean wave, flipping the fried egg in the process.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1-2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
